# UI Guidelines

## Component Usage
- All UI for the client should use PrimeReact components exclusively
- Custom components should extend PrimeReact base components
- Component props should follow consistent naming conventions
- All components should be accessible and keyboard navigable

## Theming
- Follow the defined color palette for all UI elements
- All components must support both dark and light modes
- Use theme variables rather than hardcoded color values
- Use spacing and typography tokens from the theme system

## Layout & Responsiveness
- All pages must be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- Use the grid system consistently for layouts
- Maintain appropriate content density for target devices
- Follow established navigation patterns for consistency

## Accessibility
- All UI must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Test all components with screen readers
- Maintain appropriate color contrast ratios
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

## Forms & Validation
- Use consistent error messaging patterns
- Implement inline validation where appropriate
- Group related form fields logically
- Provide clear success/error states for submissions

## Performance
- Lazy load components not visible in the initial viewport
- Optimize image delivery based on viewport size
- Implement appropriate loading states for async operations
- Monitor and maintain Lighthouse performance scores

## Documentation
- Document component usage patterns
- Create usage examples for complex components
- Maintain a living style guide
- Include accessibility notes for each component

# Enforcement
- UI reviews should validate compliance with these guidelines
- Automated tests should verify theme compatibility
- Accessibility testing should be part of the CI pipeline
- Design system documentation should be kept updated
